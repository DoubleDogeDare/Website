<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hi! I am a Junior Biology & Studio Art Major currently studying at Lewis & Clark College. I am interested in researching the mechanisms of development in animal systems as well as their ecological roles and interactions. I am also interested in photographing both landscapes and intimate spaces. </p>
